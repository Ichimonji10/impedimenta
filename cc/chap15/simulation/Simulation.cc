This program is a predator-and-prey simulation. Two types of objects are created: Ants and Doodlebugs. Ants and Doodlebugs are descendants of the Organism class. The ants and doodlebugs both live in a game board of a certain size; I recommend 20x20. Set the game board size using setBoardSize(int, int). The game board size must be set before creating and organisms. I recommend creating 100 ant and 5 doodlebug objects at the outset of the game.

The organisms, when created, should be given a location to start at. If no location is given, the organism will start at location 0,0; this is dangerous and should be avoided.
