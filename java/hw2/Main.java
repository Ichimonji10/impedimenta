To be turned in:

Your implementation of the Node class. This class should be private within the SList class.
Your implementation of the SList class.  Both classes should be appropriately commented. Note -- this means you only turn in SList.java, since the Node class will be within.
A set of tests that fully tests the SList class. Be sure to test all the public methods.  Test with more than one type, to ensure that your generics are working properly. These tests should be junit tests. Please name this file <Yourname>Test.java
Within both SList and Node, include a comment specifying the runtime performance (Big-Oh notation) of each method.
