notes on django
===============

Create a new django project:

    django-admin.py startproject site_xyz

By default, the development webserver runs on localhost:8000.

    python2.7 manage.py runserver
    python2.7 manage.py runserver 8001
    python2.7 manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8002

`settings.py` should be edited. Assuming the use of SQLite, edit `ENGINE` and
`NAME` in the `DATABASES` dict. `NAME` should be an absolute path. Also of
interest are:

* `TIME_ZONE` (e.g. `America/New_York`)
* `INSTALLED_APPS`
* `ROOT_URLCONF`
* `DEBUG`

Database tables need to be created for each of the `INSTALLED_APPS`. The
`syncdb` command will never alter an already-created table.

    python2.7 manage.py syncdb
