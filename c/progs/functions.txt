gets()
strlen()	// Evaluates the counts the length of the string held in a character array (count does not include \0)
sizeof()	// Evaluates the total size of an array, whether used or not. counts the number of bytes set aside to hold a character array (count includes \0). Can count length of data objects or data types. Parentheses are mandatory in latter case.
isalpha()	// Checks to see whether argument is an alphabetic character
switch()	// Takes integer values for arguments
case() 		// Takes integer values for arguments. Switch and case work together.
