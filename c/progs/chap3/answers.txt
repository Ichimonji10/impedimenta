1a - Either unsigned int or unsigned long int.
1b - float
1c - char
1d - unsigned int
2 - You would use a type long variable instead of type int NEVER. Long is a modifier used to modify other types of variables such as int or float. Still, long lets you (sometimes) store larger numbers.
3 - You could use either type int or type long int to get a 32-bit signed integer. Int would work because most compilers seem to compile an int as a 32-bit number. Long int would also be a good choice, because ANCI C defines the minimum for a signed int as 32 bits (of course, you run the risk of a compiler using a 64-bit number, for some reason.
4a - escape character \b, for backspace
4b - int 1066
4c - float 99.44
4d - hex number AA
4e - float 2.0*10^30
5 - see prog8.c
6 - 
7 - 
8 - see prog9.c
9 - see prog10.c
10 - see prog11.c
11a - newline
11b - backslash
11c - double quotes
11d - tab (horizontal)
