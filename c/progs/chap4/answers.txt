1 - Input is buffered when using multiple scanf() funcitons. So, say you input "Jeremy Audet" for the scanf() function. In this case, scanf() searches input and skips all types of whitespace until it comes to the first nonwhitespace character (in this case, J). scanf() reads all of Jeremy, and then reaches a whitespace " ". The next scanf continues reading, skips the " ", and reads "Audet" as input. The reason Jeremy and Audet are both read as input for scanf() is that the whitespace " " might as well be a return character. Both " " and return are different types of whitespace.
2a - %2.2f first 2 sets the minimum field width, sedcond defines the number of characters printed after the decimal point.
2b - 	H
	105
	ASCII character 41
2c - prints statement, starts new line, teslls you the number of characters included in the first string
2d - No -- e specifies scientific notation, %f specifies decimal notation.
3 - Add the escape character \" to the beginning and end of the printf() statement.

5 - see prog9.c
