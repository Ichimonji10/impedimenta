note that there is a huge difference between relational operators and arithmetic operators. How many different types of operators are there???
Relational operators establish the truth of an expression and represent that by a 1 or zero.
Arithmetic operators establish the value of an expression.
A counting loop runs a certain number of times.
if("relational operator used includes =")
	iterations = "difference between starting and ending values"
else
	iterations = "difference between starting and ending values" + 1
