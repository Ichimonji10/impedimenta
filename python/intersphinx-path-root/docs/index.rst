intersphinx-path-root
=====================

Location: :doc:`index`

The root of the intersphinx-path documentation. For information on specific plugins, see:

*   :doc:`intersphinx-path-1:index`
*   :doc:`intersphinx-path-2:index`

This package doesn't depend upon the intersphinx-path-1 or intersphinx-path-2 packages, and when
documentation is built, all projects are installed into separate venvs. As a result, none of these
packages can ``import`` modules from any of the other packages, and Sphinx extensions which import
code (such as `sphinx.ext.autodoc`_) will not work. Intersphinx lets one set of documentation link
to specific targets within another set of documentation, and it does this with inventory files
(``.inv`` files) generated by Sphinx. Inventory files describe *where* a target (like a class) can
be found in a target set of documentation, but they don't provide any more information than that.

If one wants to provide inline information on a target, but without linking to some other set of
documentation, then a directive like ``automodule`` is more appropriate. For example, this package
depends on (and can import) the requests package and its sub-modules:

.. automodule:: requests.hooks

Or to a class:

.. autoclass:: requests.exceptions.ChunkedEncodingError

.. _sphinx.ext.autodoc: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html
