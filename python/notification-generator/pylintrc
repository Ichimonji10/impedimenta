[MESSAGES CONTROL]
# PySide2 makes heavy use of C extension modules. By default, Pylint doesn't
# examine such code, as doing so is a security risk. One can whitelist a C
# extension module with the extension-pkg-whitelist option, but doing so for
# PySide2 causes a segmentation fault. (I suspect this is because of the
# enormous size of said library.) Silencing the warning is a next best option.
