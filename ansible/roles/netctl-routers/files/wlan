# A typical netctl profile brings up a physical interface, ensures that layer 2
# connectivity is present, and then configures layer 3. We do something a
# little different: we ignore layer 2. Why do we do this? Because of hostapd.
# Hostapd requires that it be able to configure the layer 2 properties of the
# interface it's managing.
#
# Why not let hostapd configure the layer 2 properties of the interface it's
# managing, and then configure the layer 3 properties here? Good question. I
# don't remember why this approach is used. (The alternative probably didn't
# work.)
#
# This profile only configures the primary interface used by hostapd. Hostapd is
# also capable of creating secondary logical interfaces. This is especially
# useful when one wants to create multiple wireless network on a single physical
# interface. (Look up "BSS.") Each secondary interface must have an IP address
# to be useful, and unfortunately, netctl isn't really compatible with such a
# use case. A solution is to write a simple systemd unit for each secondary
# interface, where the job of each systemd unit is just to configure the IP
# address of a logical interface.
