  # This task may look pointless when the systemd module can also enable and
  # disable units. However, netctl does more than systemd:
  #
  # * `netctl enable $profile` also creates a netctl@${profile}.service unit.
  # * `netctl disable $profile` also deletes a netctl@${profile}.service unit.
  # * `netctl reenable $profile` is a combination of `disable` and `enable`. It's
  #   especially useful for updating units. (`netctl enable $profile` loudly
  #   refuses to update existing units.)
  #
  # Thus, `netctl reenable` must be invoked before systemd can work with the
  # desired units.
