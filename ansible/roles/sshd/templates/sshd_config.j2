# May the root user log in via SSH?

# The default is to check both .ssh/authorized_keys and .ssh/authorized_keys2

AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys

# Set this to 'yes' to enable PAM authentication, account processing, and
# session processing. If this is enabled, PAM authentication will be allowed
# through the ChallengeResponseAuthentication and PasswordAuthentication.
# Depending on your PAM configuration, PAM authentication via
# ChallengeResponseAuthentication may bypass the setting of "PermitRootLogin
# without-password". If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run
# without PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
UsePAM yes
PrintMotd no # pam does that
PasswordAuthentication no
