# To work with systemd in user mode, XDG_RUNTIME_DIR must be set. This variable
# is set by pam_systemd when a user logs in. It is not set when commands are
# executed as another user without logging in, such as happens with sudo. This
# can lead to errors like:
#
#     Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory
#
# `become_method` is specified to avoid this problem. Also see:
