# Configuration file for dnsmasq.
#
# Format is one option per line, legal options are the same as the long options
# legal on the command line. See "/usr/sbin/dnsmasq --help" or "man 8 dnsmasq"
# for details.

# The following two options make you a better netizen, since they tell dnsmasq
# to filter out queries which the public DNS cannot answer, and which load the
# servers (especially the root servers) unnecessarily. If you have a
# dial-on-demand link they also stop these requests from bringing up the link
# unnecessarily.
#
# Never forward plain names (without a dot or domain part)
domain-needed
# Never forward addresses in the non-routed address spaces.

# If you want dnsmasq to listen for DHCP and DNS requests only on specified
# interfaces (and the loopback) give the name of the interface (eg eth0) here.
# Repeat the line for more than one interface.
interface=enp2s0
interface=enp3s0
interface=wlp4s0
interface=wlp4s0_secure

# Uncomment this to enable the integrated DHCP server, you need to supply the
# range of addresses available for lease and optionally a lease time. If you
# have more than one network, you will need to repeat this for each network on
# which you want to supply DHCP service.
