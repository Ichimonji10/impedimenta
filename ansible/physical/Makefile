# 405: Remote package tasks should have a retry
#     I'm not going to do something as offensively stupid as put an infinite
#     retry loop in my code, as suggested by ansible-lint. Also, pacman already
#     offers basic retry logic when fetching packages. No need to waste time by
#     adding yet more retries here in Ansible.
#
# 501: become_user requires become to work as expected
#     ansible-lint doesn't know how to deal with the case where `become_user: …`
#     is applied directly to a task and `become: true` is applied to a task via
#     a block statement.
#
# 701: meta/main.yml should contain relevant info
#     These modules aren't being distributed on Ansible Galaxy.
