# Configuration for resolvconf(8). See resolvconf.conf(5) for details.

# /etc/resolv.conf will list the addresses of local name servers, such as
# 127.0.0.1. Files generated by subscribers, such as dnsmasq_resolv, will list
# the addresses of other name servers. As a result:
#
# upstream
# `-- dnsmasq
#     |-- resolver
#     |   `-- local client
#     `-- network client
#
name_servers='127.0.0.1 1.0.0.1 1.1.1.1'

# Generate files for use by the local name server. The two files below list
# domain-specific and global name servers, respectively. The global name server
# file lists non-local name_servers first, and others such as those provided via
# DHCP second.
#
# If you want dnsmasq to use a specific name server and ignore resolvconf name
# servers, set the following in dnsmasq.conf:
#
#     no-resolv
#     server=$ip_of_name_server
#
# If you want dnsmasq to prefer a specific name server and fall back to others
# when it fails, then set the preferred name server in name_servers, above, and
# set the following in dnsmasq.conf:
#
#     strict-order
#
dnsmasq_conf=/etc/dnsmasq-conf.conf
dnsmasq_resolv=/etc/dnsmasq-resolv.conf

# If the resolver is asked to resolve a bare name, it will prepend that bare
# name to a list of domains, and look up the results. For example, if a client
# looks up "foo" and resolv.conf has "search example.com example.org," then the
# resolver will look up foo.example.com and foo.example.org.
#
# Setting "search" to "." causes bare names to be tacked onto the root domain,
# which effectively disables name mangling. (The local DNS resolver, dnsmasq,
# should be configured to avoid forwarding these un-resolvable bare name queries
# to upstream DNS servers.)
#
# "search" (and "domain") can be set via this file, or set via DHCP. As an
# example of the latter, a router might insert "search hsd1.vt.comcast.net" into
# resolv.conf at the behest of Comcast's DHCP servers.
#
# Set "search" to ".". The "search_domains" option does the same thing, but
# is affected by "domains_blacklist."
prepend_search='.'
# Prevent DHCP from inserting domains into "search."
domain_blacklist='*'
