# A typical netctl profile brings up a physical interface, ensures that layer 2
# connectivity is present, and then configures layer 3. We do something a
# little different: we ignore layer 2. Why do we do this? Because of hostapd.
# Hostapd requires that it be able to configure the layer 2 properties of the
# interface it's managing.
