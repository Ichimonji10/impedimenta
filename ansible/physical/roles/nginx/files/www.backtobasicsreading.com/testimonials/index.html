        When my son entered second grade, he still wasn't reading and found it
        frustrating. Mike's gentle approach created a lifelong love of reading.

        Thanks to Mike and Back to Basics Reading Clinic, school is becoming
        easier. I never could read very well, but now I can read better and
        reading is now interesting to me. Mike is the nicest person to help
        people.

        Mike is a walking, talking dictionary and I have learned a lot from him,
        more than just reading.

      <p>
        Our daughter was in seventh grade and barely reading on a third grade
        level. Her lack of self-esteem and confidence were obvious but we were
        at a loss as to what to do. The school called her "condition" dyslexia.
        Finally, at the end of my rope, I called Mike at Back To Basics Reading
        Clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been working with Mike for almost two years now. Through phonics
        and Mike's gentle persistence, today B can read well enough to be in the
        regular classroom with her peers and is achieving A's and B's in her
        classes. But more importantly she is confident in herself and chooses to
        read for leisure. She now looks forward to going to college and her
        future. I owe my daughter's future to Mike Audet and Back to Basics.
        Thanks, Mike.

      <p>
        I suspected my daughter had a learning disability even before her school
        did. Knowing of her difficulties, I brought her to see Mike Audet. For
        math she used to get pulled out of class to work with someone
        individually, now she stays in class. She is now working in the same
        math book as the rest of her class. We first tstarted coming to Mike
        between first and second grade. She could not even read at a first grade
        level. Two and a half years later, she is in fourth grade and reading at
        a fifth grade instructional level.

      <p>To the Editor</p>
      <p>
        I read the article about Mike Audet's Back to Basics clinic in the July
        7 edition of the <a href="https://www.mtngazettevt.com/">Mountain
        Gazette</a>. As a homeschooling mom, I brought my children to Mike
        Audet's clinic to make sure I was teaching my children reading in an
        effective manner. He showed me how I could work with my children at home
        and teach him phonics in a systematic yet simple fashion. His back to
        basics approach worked wonders and my seven-year-old is now reading on a
        5th grade level. My younger son, who just turned five in March, is
        reading on a first grade level. Mike gave me the tools and the
        confidence I needed to teach my children to read and I am very thankful!
        I highly recommend Mike Audet and his services to any parent with a
        child needing help with basic skills.

        Mike has been an inspiration to my wife and I with his work with our
        seven year old in his reading. Our son was finding it very hard to
        understand the concepts of reading. Mike Audet has given us the
        strategical ways of teaching and unlocking the secrets of teaching our
        child to read. We have seen a big improvement in his ability to read. He
        progresses more and more every week, and it is noticeable in his
        self-esteem. We are fortunate to be able to use Mike's services. We
        don't know what we would have done without him. Thanks Mike!

      <p>
        One year ago next month, my daughter J started being tutored by Mike. I
        received an email from her fifth grade teacher stating that J did not
        know most of her letter sounds and none of her vowel sounds. She had
        been receiving special services at school for reading since second
        grade. The day after receiving this information I was watching my other
        daughter play hockey and over heard another mother talking about her
        son. She was talking about his reading problems and how she had taken
        him to Mike for help. Her story sounded the same as J's. Before leaving
        the rink I asked for Mike's number. This was the best phone call I've
        ever made.
      </p>
      <p>
        J has always disliked and at times even hated school. Her struggles with
        reading spilled over to all subjects in school. Since working with Mike
        her confidence in her own ability to do homework and class work has
        soared. She can now sound out words she doesn't know. She went from
        being in the lowest spelling word group, to being above grade level. She
        actually likes reading now and will pick up a book without being told
        to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The icing on the cake was when she came home on the first day of school
        this year (six grade) and said she had a great day and loves school! We
        were feeling lost as to how to help our daughter and thankfully we found
        the answer for her in Mike.
