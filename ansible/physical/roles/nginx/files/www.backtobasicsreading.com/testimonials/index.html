        When my son entered second grade, he still wasn't reading and found it
        frustrating. Mike's gentle approach created a lifelong love of reading.

      <p>
        Thanks to Mike and Back to Basics Reading Clinic, school is becoming
        easier. I never could read very well, but now I can read better and
        reading is now interesting to me. Mike is the nicest person to help
        people.

      <p>
        Mike is a walking, talking dictionary and I have learned a lot from him,
        more than just reading.

        Mike, we want to thank you for helping out our dad and my husband with
        his reading. He has come a long way since he came to your clinic. Thanks
        again.

      <p>
        Our daughter was in seventh grade and barely reading on a third grade
        level. Her lack of self-esteem and confidence were obvious but we were
        at a loss as to what to do. The school called her "condition" dyslexia.
        Finally, at the end of my rope, I called Mike at Back To Basics Reading
        Clinic.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have been working with Mike for almost two years now. Through phonics
        and Mike's gentle persistence, today B can read well enough to be in the
        regular classroom with her peers and is achieving A's and B's in her
        classes. But more importantly she is confident in herself and chooses to
        read for leisure. She now looks forward to going to college and her
        future. I owe my daughter's future to Mike Audet and Back to Basics.
        Thanks, Mike.

      <p>
        I suspected my daughter had a learning disability even before her school
        did. Knowing of her difficulties, I brought her to see Mike Audet. For
        math she used to get pulled out of class to work with someone
        individually, now she stays in class. She is now working in the same
        math book as the rest of her class. We first tstarted coming to Mike
        between first and second grade. She could not even read at a first grade
        level. Two and a half years later, she is in fourth grade and reading at
        a fifth grade instructional level.

      <p>To the Editor</p>
      <p>
        I read the article about Mike Audet's Back to Basics clinic in the July
        7 edition of the <a href="https://www.mtngazettevt.com/">Mountain
        Gazette</a>. As a homeschooling mom, I brought my children to Mike
        Audet's clinic to make sure I was teaching my children reading in an
        effective manner. He showed me how I could work with my children at home
        and teach him phonics in a systematic yet simple fashion. His back to
        basics approach worked wonders and my seven-year-old is now reading on a
        5th grade level. My younger son, who just turned five in March, is
        reading on a first grade level. Mike gave me the tools and the
        confidence I needed to teach my children to read and I am very thankful!
        I highly recommend Mike Audet and his services to any parent with a
        child needing help with basic skills.

        Please consider this an announcement and a thank you, rather than a

        Thank you for your help in making P's senior year an honor roll year,
        math aside! He is deferred from English and Human Biology exams, since
        he has "A's" in both.

      <p>
        We feel very fortunate to have found Mike's Back to Basics Reading
        Clinic. Our children needed help with phonics, but Mike expanded the
        program to include mathematics, history, and even Greek and Latin. The
        comprehensive education Mike offers has given our children a firm
        foundation and love of learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mike's warmth, humor and encouragement have made our weekly visits a
        pleasure for the whole family!
