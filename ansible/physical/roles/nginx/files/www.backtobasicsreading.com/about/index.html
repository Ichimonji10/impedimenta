    <h1>About the Clinic</h1>
    <p>
      When you arrive at Back to Basics Reading Clinic, drive up the driveway and
      turn right into the parking lot. Come through the gate and up the steps to
      enter the clinic. You will be greeted by one labrador retriever, colored
      brown. He loves children and children love him! Please let us know if you
      have allergies.
    </p>
    <h1>Testimonials</h1>
    <blockquote>
      <p>When my son entered second grade, he still wasn't reading and
        found it frustrating. Mike's gentle approach created a lifelong
        love of reading.
      </p>
