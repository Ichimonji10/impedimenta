    <h1>Meet Mike Audet</h1>
    <p>My name is Mike Audet. I am a Certified Master Tutor and have been
      teaching children and adults for over twenty years. I teach teach
      reading, writing, and arithmetic, as well as grammar, history, science,
      spelling, and Greek and Latin etymology. I do one-on-one tutoring and
      teach reading using traditional phonics, basic arithmetic instruction
      using traditional algorithms, and grammar using traditional workbooks.
      I am an adjunct professor of psychology, health sciences, and
      counseling. I provide power point reading presentations for a nominal
      fee.
    </p>
    <h1>About the Program</h1>
    <p>At Back to Basics Reading Clinic, my aim is to teach students how to
      focus and work on academic basics. Many schools fall far short of
      developing the full potential of children because they fail to teach
      the basics: reading, writing, spelling, grammar, and arithmetic, in a
      sequential, additive manner.  It is essential to begin building a solid
      foundation of knowledge in the early grades, when children are the most
      receptive.

    <h2>Reading</h2>
    <p>At Back to Basics, children are taught the alphabetic code and the
      sound-symbol relationships, including short and long vowel sounds and
      the accompanying diacritical marks. Getting "Back to Basics" means
      teaching children how to hold their pencils correctly, how to form
      letters and numbers, how to sound out words, and how to spell
      phonetically using basic grammar rules.
    </p>
    <p>The curriculum at Back to Basics is based upon the alphabetic code
      and phonetic principles rather than the whole-word methodology. The
      relationship between the 26 letters of the alphabet and the 44 sounds
      they represent are taught to students. This forms the foundation for
      further skill growth.

    <h2>Math</h2>
    <p>We stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to arithmetic. In
      the past two thousand years mathematicians have shown us the most
      sensible and efficient algorithms for solving addition, subtraction,
      multiplication, and division problems. I start with these basic skills
      and progress to abstract word problems when the child has mastered the
      needed skills and is developmentally ready.
    </p>
    <p>I use traditional arithmetic work books that contain traditional
      algorithms as well as word problems. Each lesson containing new
      material is presented at the top of the workbook page and it is vital
      that students hear a thorough explanation of each concept and see
      procedures demonstrated step-by-step by the teacher.
