    <h2>About Mike Audet</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Mike Audet. I am a Certified Master Tutor and have been
      teaching children and adults for over twenty years. I teach reading,
      writing, and arithmetic, as well as grammar, history, science, spelling,
      and Greek and Latin etymology. I do one-on-one tutoring and teach reading
      using traditional phonics, basic arithmetic instruction using traditional
      algorithms, and grammar using traditional workbooks. I am an adjunct
      professor of psychology, health sciences, and counseling. I provide power
      point reading presentations for a nominal fee.
    </p>
    <p>
      I did my undergraduate work at University of Vermont and Burlington
      College, studying Geology, European History, and Counseling Psychology. I
      earned my MA in Counseling Psychology at the Antioch New England Graduate
      School in Keene, NH, graduating Summa Cum Laude.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have many years of classroom teaching experience as an adjunct professor
      of Psychology, Health Sciences, and Counseling. I am also a Licensed
      Clinical Mental Health Counselor and a Certified Master Tutor, having
      earned my tutoring certificate at Johnson State College.

    <h2>About the Program</h2>
    <p>
      At Back to Basics Reading Clinic, my aim is to teach students how to focus
      and work on academic basics. Many schools fall far short of developing the
      full potential of children because they fail to teach the basics: reading,
      writing, spelling, grammar, and arithmetic, in a sequential, additive
      manner. It is essential to begin building a solid foundation of knowledge
      in the early grades, when children are the most receptive.

    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>
      At Back to Basics, children are taught the alphabetic code and the
      sound-symbol relationships, including short and long vowel sounds and the
      accompanying diacritical marks. Getting "Back to Basics" means teaching
      children how to hold their pencils correctly, how to form letters and
      numbers, how to sound out words, and how to spell phonetically using basic
      grammar rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curriculum at Back to Basics is based upon the alphabetic code and
      phonetic principles rather than the whole-word methodology. The
      relationship between the 26 letters of the alphabet and the 44 sounds they
      represent are taught to students. This forms the foundation for further
      skill growth.

    <h3>Math</h3>
    <p>
      We stand on the shoulders of giants when it comes to arithmetic. In the
      past two thousand years mathematicians have shown us the most sensible and
      efficient algorithms for solving addition, subtraction, multiplication,
      and division problems. I start with these basic skills and progress to
      abstract word problems when the child has mastered the needed skills and
      is developmentally ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      I use traditional arithmetic work books that contain traditional
      algorithms as well as word problems. Each lesson containing new material
      is presented at the top of the workbook page and it is vital that students
      hear a thorough explanation of each concept and see procedures
      demonstrated step-by-step by the teacher.
    </p>
