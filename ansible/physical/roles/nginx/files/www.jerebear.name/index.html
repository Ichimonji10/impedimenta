    You can get an OK understanding of my skill set by checking out my <a
    href='http://www.linkedin.com/in/jeremyaudet'>LinkedIn</a> and <a
    href='https://github.com/Ichimonji10'>GitHub</a> profiles. Here's some
    highlights:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      I worked as a Quality Engineer at Red Hat from 2014â€“2018.
    </li>
    <li>
      I've earned an A.S. in computer engineering and a B.S. in software
      engineering from <a href="https://www.vtc.edu/">Vermont Technical
      College</a>, and I'm currently pursing an M.S. in software engineering
      from the same.
    </li>
    <li>
      I know about software engineering, Linux system administration, computer
      networking and computer engineering, in that order. I'm especially
      proficient with Python.
    </li>
  </ul>

  </p>
  <p>
    Outside of work, I like to geek out over computer projects, engage in
    non-team sports such as lifting and hiking, consume a steady diet of books
    and podcasts, and spend time with friends and family. I'm modestly engaged
    with the Arch Linux community: I maintain packages, edit the wiki, and
    participate in mailing lists, among other things.
