A method signature is the declaration of a function. A function in C is called a method in C++. 

what is a namespace?
what is a 2d array?
??? A 2d array is something like int numAray[3][4]; ???

The :: denotes the relationship between a method and namespace. A namespace is a wrapper in which all methods should have unique names. This is similar to funtions. Inside a function, each variable should have a unique name.
OR
:: is a scope resolution operator.

Express your intent. Do not use expressions such as 2*(n++). Use expressive variable and function names.

Figure out the difference between a class and a struct. A class describes an object. There may be many or no objects in a program.
