# nopriv_user
# Default: nobody
# This is the name of the user that is used by vsftpd when it wants to be
# totally unprivileged. Note that this should be a dedicated user, rather than
# nobody. The user nobody tends to be used for rather a lot of important things
# on most machines.

# listen
# Default: NO
# The vsftpd server can run in standalone mode or be supported by inetd/xinetd.
# To enable standalone mode set listen=YES

# write_enable
# Default: NO
# This controls whether any FTP commands which change the filesystem are
# allowed or not.

# connect_from_port_20
# Default: NO
# This controls whether PORT style data connections use port 20 (ftp-data) on
# the server machine. For security reasons, some clients may insist that this
# is the case. Conversely, disabling this option enables vsftpd to run with
# slightly less privilege.

# xferlog_enable
# Default: NO
# If enabled, a log file will be maintained detailling uploads and downloads.
# By default, this file will be placed at /var/log/vsftpd.log, but this
# location may be overridden using the configuration setting vsftpd_log_file.

# anon_root
# Default: (none)
# This option represents a directory which vsftpd will try to change into
# after an anonymous login. Failure is silently ignored.

# anon_upload_enable
# Default: NO
# For this to work, the option write_enable must be activated, and the
# anonymous ftp user must have write permission on desired upload locations.

# anon_mkdir_write_enable
# Default: NO
# If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to create new directories
# under certain conditions. For this to work, the option write_enable must be
# activated, and the anonymous ftp user must have write permission on the
# parent directory.

# anon_other_write_enable
# Default: NO
# If set to YES, anonymous users will be permitted to perform write operations
# other than upload and create directory, such as deletion and renaming. This
# is generally not recommended but included for completeness.

# anon_umask
# Default: 077
# The value that the umask for file creation is set to for  anony‚Äê mous users.
# NOTE! If you want to specify octal values, remember the "0" prefix otherwise
# the value will be treated as a base  10 integer!

# anon_world_readable_only
# Default: YES
# When enabled, anonymous users will only be allowed to download files which
# are world readable. This is recognising that the ftp user may own files,
# especially in the presence of uploads.
