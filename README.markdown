About
=====

This repo is a warehouse for code I've written. Much of it has been written for
school assignment, but there's also personal projects and non-critical code from
work. Most of this code is utter crap, and there's no guarantee about when I'll
decide to do some spring cleaning.

There is no particular focus to this repo, nor should there be.
