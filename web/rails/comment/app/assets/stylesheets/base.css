/* The above is a hack which compensates for bad browser behaviour. If a "float:
 * left" block is placed right next to <li> elements, the <li> bullets will
 * overflow onto the float. This looks disgusting, and is annoying.  There are
 * several possible solutions:
 *
 *     ul li {
 *         position: relative;
 *         left: 1em;
 *         padding-right: 1em;
 *     }
 *
 * A bad solution. The resultant page is always wider than the browser's
 * viewport, which produces a scrollbar on the bottom of the viewport. Annoying.
 *
 *     ul {
 *         overflow: hidden;
 *     }
 *
 * How... magical. I don't understand why this works, so I'm avoiding it.
 *
 *     ul {
 *         list-style-position: inside;
 *     }
 *
 * Works well, and easily comprehensible. The downside? It destroys the
 * indentation normally produced by a <li>. (which is what's supposed to happen
 * with this CSS rule) As a result, any decently long <li> looks fugly.
 *
 *     ul {
 *         display: table;
 *     }
 *
 * Forces the entire <ul> into a single, rectangular area. Works well, except
 * when a list gets decently long. Then, this rule just destroys the normal flow
 * of the document.
