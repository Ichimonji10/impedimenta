Assignment 2
============

Part 1
------

I like the interactivity of [Duck Duck Go](duckduckgo.com). To the best of my
knowledge, the site does not offer an API. The site does combine data from
multiple sources, which qualifies it as a mashup.

Try the following queries:

* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=weather+05489
* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=89+kph+in+mph
* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=xkcd+1024
* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=define+impedimenta

Each of these queries causes DDG to query an API provided by an external service
and. The four queries above query World Weather Online, Wolfram Alpha, XKCD and
Wordnik, respectively.

My favorite DDG feature is "bangs". Try the following queries:

* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!wiki+openstreetmap
* https://duckduckgo.com/?q=!aur+bastion

The first query, above, causes DDG to redirect the user to the Wikipedia page on
OpenStreetMap. The second query causes DDG to redirect the user to the Arch User
Repository web site, which then performs its *own* query. I find this
interesting from an academic standpoint, as it is an explicit recognition that
there are methods of hooking in to the web that do not involve the use of APIs.
