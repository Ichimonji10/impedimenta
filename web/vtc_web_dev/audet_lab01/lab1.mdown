Exercise 1
----------

Address: www.housingmaps.com

Q. What is being combined?

Mapping data from Google Maps and posting content from Craigslist are being
combined.

Q. Why are these elements being combined?

These elements are being combined to make the search for housing easier. By
combining mapping and posting data together, users can more easily visualize
where postings refer to and discover postings in a given area.

Q. Where is the remixing or recombination happening?

The remixing appears to be a mix of client-side and server-side actions. The
google maps data is client-side: the user uses javascript and the google maps
API to pull down some of google's mapping data. It's not clear where the
craigslist data comes from, but I'd guess that the www.housingmaps.com server
scrapes data from craigslist and clients fetch the scraped data from
www.housingmaps.com.

Q. How are the elements connected toghter - both _visually_ in the interface,
and _technically_ in the application machinery?

Visually, elements are connected _spatially_. Geographic information from
craigslist is used to generate markers on the google maps. Technically,
javascript pulls the two data sources together.

Exercise 2
----------

Address: www.earthalbum.com

Q. What is being combined?

Photos from Flickr and mapping data from Google Maps are being combined.

Q. Why are these elements being combined?

These elements are being combined to give "armchair tourists" an informal look
at the world through photographs. A site like this makes it possible to view
photos of all kinds -- formal and informal -- based on (presumably) their
embedded geotagging information.

Q. Where is the remixing or recombination happening?

The remixing appears to be happening entirely client-side. Some Javascript pulls
mapping information from Google Maps, and more javascript pulls photos from
Flickr.

Q. How are the elements connected toghter - both _visually_ in the interface,
and _technically_ in the application machinery?

The elements are connected together, visually, through the use of spatial
information. A rectangle drawn on the map shows the bounds from wherein photos
are taken. Technically, geotagging information from Flickr's photos is combined
with geographic information from Google Maps.

Exercise 3

Address: http://www.josefrichter.com/helvetwitter/

Q. What is being combined?

Well, I couldn't figure out how to use Helvetwitter, so I can't really say.

However, I believe the elements being combined are the twitter website and some
clever JavaScript. According to the source of the script, it "remove twitter's
style tag from head", "replace twitter's linked css with my custom css", "reload
every 5 minutes.", and "don't reload if you're just typing a new tweet".

Q. Why are these elements being combined?

These elements are being combined to clean up Twitter's UI.

Q. Where is the remixing or recombination happening?

The remix is happening almost entirely client-side. The only external data
sources that need to be pulled in are some CSS files and Twitter's website.

Q. How are the elements connected toghter - both _visually_ in the interface,
and _technically_ in the application machinery?

Helvetwitter doesn't connect any elements together in a visually obvious way.
Instead it mashes up behind-the-scenes elements such as CSS and HTML to create
something new and interesting.

Exercise 4

Freebie!

Exercise 5
----------

Address: www.programmableweb.com
Address: http://minimap.eu/demos/exhibition/mobile/en/map-en/#

Q. What is being combined?

The elements being combined are:

1. A map of an exhibition hall.
2. Google maps data.

Q. Why are these elements being combined?

These elements are being combined "to display a detailed illustration of the
Vinexpo 2013 facilities. This allows visitors to easily find exactly what they
are looking for."

Q. Where is the remixing or recombination happening?

The remixing is happening entirely client-side. A client web browser stitches
together google maps data and an image of the Vinexpo facilities to create a
mashup.

Q. How are the elements connected toghter - both _visually_ in the interface,
and _technically_ in the application machinery?

Visually, the elements are connected _spatially_. Mapping data from Google Maps
and a map from of the Vinexpo exhibition are stitched together in a spatially
accurate way to give the user useful information.
