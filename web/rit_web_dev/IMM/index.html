            My name is Jeremy Audet, and I'm from Vermont, the most beautiful state in the union. If you ever get a chance to visit Vermont, do so. Even in mud season, you'll find something to appreciate.

            As my dad would say, I am a social solitary person. I'm happy to play a game of racquetball or frisbee with you, or spend the rare afternoon at the beach. However, you're more likely to find me biking, reading, or learning about computer technology.

            First and foremost, I'm a computer geek. I've worked as an independent computer technician, computer sales representative, computer depot technician, system operator, and embedded systems engineer. Few of those positions are glorious or respected, but together they give a good understanding of the computer industry. My education and several of my hobbies are based on this interest in computers. I have earned an Associate's in Computer Engineering from Vermont Technical College, and am currently pursing a Bachelor's in Applied Networking & System Administration at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I am also a Linux devotee, and use distributions such as Arch Linux for personal use.

            I took this course simply because it's necessary for my major. Of course, I'm also happy to learn more concrete details about computer systems in the process. My knowledge of (X)HTML has already been significantly fleshed out, and I'm sure there's more to come. My greatest computer-related interest is in the field of networking. Networking is special because of its absorbing combination of the concrete, abstract, and practical. Though precisely defined protocols such as OSPF and IP provide the foundation for networks, a network administrator must also consider the aggregate behaviour of an agglomeration of networked devices. Further, the network administrator must deal with all these concerns within the bounds set by finances, security requirements, and more.

            My dream career involves designing and administering computer networks for a worthwhile organization. If I do my job right, no end user will even need to know I'm there.
