Safari is a web browser backed by Apple, Inc. The beta version of Safari was made available on January 7, 2003, and it became Apple's default web browser when Mac OSX v10.3 "Panther" was released on October 24, 2003. It became available to the Windows platform on June 11, 2007. Windows XP, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 are currently supported. There is also a mobile version available, used on iOS.

There are several different ways to measure the popularity of web browsers. Net Market Share, for example, has one set of statistics for desktop operating systems and another for mobile operating systems. They also weight their numbers to take into account geographic preferences for browser usage. As of August 2011, Net Market Share shows Safari to be the fourth most popular desktop browser, holding 4.64 percent of the market. This is ahead of browsers such as Opera and Konqueror, but behind Chrome, Firefox, and Internet Explorer. In the mobile market, Safari commands a full 52.99 percent market share. This is ahead of other mobile browsers such as Opera Mini and Android Browser.

Safari has acheived several notable firsts. It was the first browser to implement privacy mode, and it was the first browser to sucessfully pass the Acid2 web standards compliance test. Despite these acheivements, it also has a history of security vulnerabilities. It has been hacked at all five pwn2own contests (2007-2011). Components such as its autofill feature and quicktime plugin have been vulnerable to attackes.
