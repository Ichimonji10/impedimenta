            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>The repository does not exist in a vacuum, and neither does the author. Here, you'll find resources that I have used (or have simply influenced me to a great degree) in the creation of this website.</p>

            <h2>Resources</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>I had forgotten the most common ways of writing output to STDOUT. But for <a href="http://bit.ly/vYrB2y">Beej's Guide to C</a>, I would still be using printf()!</li>
                <li><a href="http://bit.ly/ukiiwB">C++ Primer Plus, by Stephen Prata &#40;ISBN: 0131388207, 9780131388208&#41;</a> is the book that taught me C++. Exceptional quality writing.</li>
                <li>The folks over at <a href="http://bit.ly/vZzJCA">PerlMonks</a> have a preternatural knowledge of Perl.</li>
                <li>Special thanks so the <a href="http://source.android.com/">Android Open Source Project</a>. Their <a href="http://developer.android.com/guide/index.html">documentation</a> is truly amazing.</li>

            <h2>Project 3</h2>
            <h3>Grading Notes</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>The graphics shown below are what I created for this project.</li>
                <li>For rich media, I chose to embed a youtube video. It's found on <em>this very page</em>!</li>
                <li>The secondary navigation system is the navigation column on the left hand side of every page.</li>
                <li>The graphic/logo shown on each page uses a CSS image rollover effect.</li>
                <li>No JavaScript is used in this web site.</li>
            </ol>
            <img src="./images/logo.png"        alt="logo with no decorations" />
            <img src="./images/logo_jra.png"    alt="logo with initials" />
            <img src="./images/logo_home.png"   alt="logo with the word 'home'" />
            <p>I had a tough time figuring out how to create these graphics, and the video below helped me finish the project. Full disclosure: I used GIMP to create these graphics, not photoshop.</p>

            <h3>Project 3 Summary</h3>
            <p>Here's what I think was done really well on this site:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Content. Though I have previously worked with all the languages (and platforms) shown on this site, I have not kept up with them. In the process of creating this site, I had to go back and re-learn the basic syntax of several languages, and even learned a few tricks along the way. If you still doubt me, check out the Android page, or the comments in my Perl source code.</li>
                <li>Design, both technical and aesthetic. Yes, I improved the look of the website (I'm no longer using an overly dark tone). But even more than that, I made sure the site was well-constructed. For example, inspect the navbar elements on the left side of the page. In project 2, the nav elements overflowed their container (due to extra border width), while in project 3 they don't (due to inset drop shadows). Tough! There are other small touches all around the site: code blocks add scroll bars when text starts overflowing, the dotted vertical line helps with readability, the logo/graphic will never interfere with main page content (even when the browser window is shrunk down), and pictures are clickable.</li>
                <li>Incidental work. In the making of this site, I installed the Android platform and created a "Hello, world!" project from scratch. I installed Apache web server, and figured out how to create a (fairly) secure install. (Really: there are a <em>lot</em> of ways the default Apache install can abused) These projects are outside the scope of the class, but they required a <em>considerable</em> investment of time and effort.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Here's what's not up to par:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Mobile access. I briefly tried making my site mobile-accessible, and then discovered how fragmented support for the mobile landscape really is. I really should persist and figure out how to create a mobile version of the site, but did not.</li>
                <li>Server side includes. Each page on the website has several common elements (e.g. navbars), and SSIs would make the site easier to maintain.</li>
            </ol>
