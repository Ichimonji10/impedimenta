            <p>I grew up in Vermont, the most beautiful state in the union. If you ever get a chance to visit Vermont, do so. Even in mud season, you'll find something to appreciate. Try some real maple syrup -- Aunt Jemima's can't compare.</p>
            <p>When not working with computers, you're likely to find me reading. I adore good science fiction, such as Isaac Asimov's <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foundation_series">Foundation series</a>, or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dune_%28novel%29">Dune</a> by Frank Herbert. Of course, my reading list is not restricted by that genre. <a href="http://www.marklavorato.com/ML/Books.html">Veracity</a> by Mark Lavorato, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen">Watchmen</a> written by Alan Moore, and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_History_of_Rasselas,_Prince_of_Abissinia">Rasselas</a> by Samuel Johnson are worth your time. Indeed, they should demand it. I also have an enduring interest in cultural history, and especially how tech policy affects the shape of culture today. The smartphone industry provides a fascinating, modern-day <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/09/owning-the-stack-the-legal-war-for-control-of-the-smartphone-platform.ars">case study</a> in how policy can shape markets. If you're willing to look further back, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Piracy-Intellectual-Property-Gutenberg-Gates/dp/0226401189">Piracy</a> by Adrian Johns and <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2010/06/where-good-ideas-come-from.html">Where Good Ideas Come From</a> by Steven Johnson are both excellent reads.</p>
            <p>When I give myself the time, I'm also happy to play racquetball, go on a bike trip, or hike a mountain. Someday, I hope to bike across the country (or at least across Vermont). I know I can do it, too -- even with everything else to do, I've gone on at least one fifty-plus mile bike ride each year since 2010.</p>
            <p>The one character trait I cannot stand in a person is boredom. Freedom from present pressures is something rare.</p>
