About
=====

This repo is an all-encompassing warehouse for code I've written. Much of it has
been written for school assignments, but there's also personal projects and
non-critical code from work. Much of this code is also utter crap, and there's
no guarantee about when I'll decide to do some spring cleaning.

tldr: There is no particular focus to this repo.
