About the Chip
/-----------------------------------------------------------------------------*/
I am working with the MC9S08QG8 chip. It has ??? memory and ??? ROM...

There are three registers: the accumulator (A), and the H and X registers. A generally holds the result of mathematical operations. The H and X registers can function as a single 16 bit register, though this is not a well integrated function.

SP is the stack pointer. The SP points to the top of the stack. The stack notes where a function was when it passed control to a new function.

CCR is the Condition Code Register. The CCR is an eight bit register, but only six bits are used. Those six bits note any special actions which have occurred. For example, a bit will be set if A was set to zero.

PC is the Program Counter. The PC denotes the location in memory where the next executable statement is located. i.e. The PC denotes where in memory the next statement to be executed resides.

The PTADD controls the PTAD. The PTADD determines whether each bit on the PTAD acts as input or output. If PTADD is 00000001, then only the last bit of PTAD can act as output. If PTAD is then set to 00001111, only one physical device will respond by turning on. If PTAD is set to 11110000, then only one physical device will respond by turning off.

To perform a two's complement, invert the bits and add one. Another way to think about two's complement: perform one's complement, then add one. A two's complement allows you to get a number of equal magnitude but opposite polarity from what you started with. 

The two's complement is useful when attempting to read a negative number. Perform a two's complement, and then read the number normally. A two's complement is also useful when attempting to subtract any number from some other value. Just perform the two's complement on the number you are subtracting, and then add the two values together.

Binary numbers are preceded with a %. Hex numbers are preceded with a $. Decimal numbers are not preceded with any symbol. Precede a number with a # to interpret the following number as a numeric value, rather than a memory address.
