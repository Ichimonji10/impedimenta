Basic Pulp Performance Testing
==============================

This directory contains some *extremely* basic Pulp performance tests.

These tests perform some number of actions some number of times, and record how
long each iteration takes. Afterwards, arbitrary analyses can be performed on
the recorded times.

For more information, see the make file.
